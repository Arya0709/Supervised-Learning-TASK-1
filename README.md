# Supervised-Learning-TASK-1
PREDICTION OF PERCENTAGE USING SUPERVISED LEARNING
We have imported all the necessary libraries which are pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
In the next step we have read the dataset using pandas
then we have printed the heatmap for the dataset
then we checked if there are any null values in the dataset and its found that there are no null values 
then we have plotted our dataset
then we seprated input and out in x and y variables respectively
then we split our dataset into training and testing
then we trained our dataset using sklearn linear regression modle
after training we plot a prediction line also known as hypothesis
then we test our data and check the actual values and predicted value which comes out to be close to each other
then we predict the score for 9.25 hours andd it comes out to be approximately 93
then the find the mean absolute error.
